To add and manage posts, just edit the Markdown files inside the `docs` folder.

To make core changes/updates, clone the main branch and:
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run docs:dev`

or

1. `yarn install`
1. `yarn run docs:dev`

Commit the changes to the main branch and the GitHub Pages will do its job.
