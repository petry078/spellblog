To add/manage pages and posts, just edit the Markdown files inside the `docs` folder.

To make framework changes/updates, clone the main branch and:
1. `npm install`
1. `npm run docs:dev`

or

1. `yarn install`
1. `yarn run docs:dev`

Commit the changes to the main branch and the GitHub Pages will do its job.

## Future work

* [] New home page. Same GIF. Word by word professional definition and links. Button to spells.
* [] Old home will become `/spells`. "At this point... this can be called spells".
* [] Navbar update.
* [] Date-oriented filename refactor. Messy I know...
