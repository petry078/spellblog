# API enchantment with JavaScript

{Intro on APIs and RESTful APIs}

## 1. The Fetch API 

{The Request/Response concept}

Fetch API GET request:

Request: call `fetch(./rainbow.jpg)`
Response: a stream of data in a format of a file. Examples: JSON, plain text, HTML, XML, PNG, JPG, GIF, SVG, PDF, CSV, binary files and error responses (status code).

```javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => {
    // Handle the data returned by the server
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // Handle any errors that occurred during the request
    console.error(error);
  });
```
