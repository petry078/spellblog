# About

Welcome internet traveler!

This is a blog with **VuePress v2.x**. Here, **HTML** pages are replaced with **Markdown** pages. Who dosent love markdown, right?

The Vuepress framework makes all these **shenanigans**, markdown-html rendering, and front-end routing. It is pretty fast and cool!

Here I plan to write how to use the tools I'm currently learning about web development and other articles, spell recepies...
